<marquee> Battle Cats Rule! </marquee>

	<p> In battle cats, you play as the cat army. </p>
	<p> You lead a group of different cats with different abilites to conquer all of the levels. </p>
	<p> You start off with the basic cat. Then you get a tank cat who has more health than a basic cat but has way and I mean way less damage. </p>
	<p> Then you move onto the more useful cats. You first get a cat known as the axe cat. It is strong agains red color typed enemies. Then you get the gross cat. It has super long legs and it does about a hundred damage per hit at level one.</p>
	<p> Overtime, you gain new cats such as the bird and fish cat ubut with enough patience, you can reach the actually good cats. ... </p>
	<p> Soon, you'll get the lizard cat that does a ton of damage and has very high dps (damage per second) for a basic cat. You can use your lizard cat to finally unlock the best basic at there is (In my opinion, Of course). You'll unlock the titan cat who is very tanky and does quite a lot of damage. The only draw back is that he is quite expensive to deploy.</p>
	<p> From there, you'll unlock the special cats menu in the upgrade section. </p>
	<p> You can buy special cats in that menu with catfood. </p>
	<p> You can get catfood by going to the store or by getting ot from reaching milestines in your battle cats career.</p>
